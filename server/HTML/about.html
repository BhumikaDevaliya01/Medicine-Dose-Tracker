          This website had been built by
          <b>Divya Patel, Bhumika Devaliya, Hemil Darji, Dev Solanki</b> and
          <b>Yash Panchal</b> to solve the problem of all people from all ages
          but especially for old aged person who have to take so many of
          medicine on everyday basis because of some kind of diseases or
          anything that they might suffering from, so due to this we make this
          website to remind them for taking their medicine on time without
          forgetting it.
        </p>
        <h3 class="content-header">Functionality</h3>
        <p class="content">
          This website helps people for intaking their medicine on time without
          forgetting it, but yes they should have to be logged on in our
          website, so that whatever Email they had use at the time of login they
          will get their notification on that particular mail-id so they have to
          be active on that. Additionally, they independently set the timer of
          as many medicine they want to take and also they have to enter their
          drugs name so that they get to know which medicine they have to take
          with mentioning their pricing for particular tablet or any medicine to
          keep the record of it, so they get to know how much they spent on it.
        </p>
        <h3 class="content-header">How it's made?</h3>
        <p class="content">
          We use some basic tools to made this webiste like
          <b>Visual Studio Code</b>. So, <i>Visual Studio Code</i> is a
          lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop
          and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in
          support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich
          ecosystem of extensions for other languages
          <i>(such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go)</i> and runtimes
          <i>(such as .NET and Unity)</i>. Moreover, we use <b>MongoDB</b> for
          storing the user data in it. <i>MongoDB</i> is a document-oriented
          NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. Instead of using
          tables and rows as in the traditional relational databases, MongoDB
          makes use of collections and documents. Documents consist of key-value
          pairs which are the basic unit of data in MongoDB. And some other
          languages for making our webiste efficienct.
