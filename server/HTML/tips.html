        <h3>How will I know if someone is having a heart attack?</h3>
        <section>
          <p>
            A heart attack (myocardial infarction) occurs when the heart can’t
            get enough oxygen. A lack of oxygen causes the heart muscle to die.
            The most common symptom is chest pain. But this is only half the
            story. Sometimes people can have other symptoms with—or
            without—chest pain including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Any type of chest discomfort or pressure, such as squeezing or
              achiness
            </li>
            <li>Feeling queasy or throwing up</li>
            <li>Looking “white as a ghost” (very pale)</li>
            <li>Breaking out in a cold sweat</li>
            <li>Feelings of dread or doom</li>
            <li>
              Pain, or achiness in your back, shoulders, arms, neck or jaw
            </li>
            <li>Dizziness or passing out</li>
            <li>Weakness or feeling unusually tired</li>
            <li>Difficulty breathing</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Providing Immediate Heart Attack First Aid</h2>
          <h4>For a Conscious Patient:</h4>
          <p>
            Heart attack first aid for a patient who doesn't losses his/her
            consciousness
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ease strain on the patient’s heart by helping them in a
              comfortable position. An ideal position is on the floor, leaning
              against a wall with head and shoulders supported and knees bent.
            </li>
            <li>
              Loosen the clothing around their neck, chest and waist. For
              instance, if they are wearing a tie, remove it and unbutton the
              top button.
            </li>
            <li>
              Call for help but don’t let bystanders crowd the patient. Avoid
              leaving the patient unattended.
            </li>
            <li>
              Call an emergency helpline number 112 or 102 for an ambulance. You
              can call the local, neighbourhood hospital if you believe that’s
              going to be quicker.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the patient has prescribed medicine for a cardiovascular
              diseases, help them take it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Continuously monitor the patient — check their breathing, pulse
              and keep an eye on their consciousness.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>For an Unconscious Patient:</h4>
          <p>
            Heart attack first aid for a patient who loses consciousness goes a
            little beyond the above steps.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Make sure to inform the ambulance/emergency number operator that
              the patient is unconscious. This is essential because they will
              despatch the ambulance with needed equipment like a defibrillator,
              which is used to restart the heart, ECG machine, ventilator,
              oxygen cylinder, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is advised when the patient is
              unconscious.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you aren't trained in CPR, provide hands-only chest
              compressions. You can be guided by the emergency number
              operator/medical assist on call to perform them.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>How to Give Chest Compressions (for adults)</h2>
          <p>
            Chest compression is the act of applying pressure to someone's chest
            in order to help blood flow through the heart in an emergency
            situation.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              On the centre of the patient’s chest, place the heel of your hand,
              one on top of the other and lace your fingers together.
            </li>
            <li>
              Keep your shoulders directly above your hands and straighten out
              your arms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Compress chest at least by 2 inches by pushing hard and fast.
            </li>
            <li>
              Compress at least 100 times per minute with minimal interruptions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Let the patient’s chest rise completely before you push down
              again.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stop only if the patient starts breathing normally again, a
              trained person or medical assistant takes over, you’re too
              exhausted to continue properly or an automated external
              defibrillator (AED) is available.
